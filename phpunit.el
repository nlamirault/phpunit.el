;;; Commentary:

;; Thanks to tox.el(https://github.com/chmouel/tox.el) from Chmouel Boudjnah.

;; To use this code, bind the functions `phpunit-current-test', `phpunit-current-class'
;; and `phpunit-current-project' to convenient keys with something like :

;; (define-key web-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'phpunit-current-class)
;; (define-key web-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'phpunit-current-project)

;;; Code:

(require 's)
(require 'f)

(defgroup phpunit nil
  "PHPUnit utility"
  :group 'php)

(defcustom phpunit-program "phpunit"
  "PHPUnit binary path."
  :type 'file
  :group 'phpunit)

(defcustom phpunit-arg ""
  "Argument to pass to phpunit."
  :type 'string
  :group 'phpunit)

;; Commands
;; -----------


(defun phpunit-get-program (test)
  "Return the command to launch unit test.
`TEST' corresponds to a classname, or a testname."
  (concat phpunit-program " -c "
	  (phpunit-get-root-directory)
	  "phpunit.xml"
	  test))


(defun phpunit-get-root-directory()
